This is a pytube wrapper that allows for downloading 1080p videos with audio streams. Downloads audio and video as separate files and then pieces them back together using ffmpeg. Use wisely.

### Requirements
* ffmpeg
* pytube

### How to Use?:
1. Open file and set your output folder on line 6 ( will revamp this for sure.)
2. Run the file
3. Use simple the simple command line gui :) 

### Upcoming Features:
* higher resolution downloads
* file management system for different channels, playlist and videos
* autoscheduling downloads
* build a proper GUI system ( this is coder-centric project so this won't be coming for a while)
